# Farlight 84 DMA

My ~~First~~  WIP Attempt at an unreal Engine Cheat ...

Very Messy...
Originally was working on Marvel Rivals Based on Base from [Rivals DMA](https://github.com/boggymc/MarvelRivals-DMA)
But i got Banned, Then i had a Delta Force ESP going before ban and encryption same for ABI... So i decided to use farlight , this was the second version i made.



## Completed
- Basic ESP
- Basic leftover aimbot
## Planned :
-  ~~Learn how to properly loop actor list~~
-  Learn how to really properly cache
-  ~~Fix item esp~~
-  finish menu
-  so much more
